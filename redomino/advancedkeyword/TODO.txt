TODO
====

Todo list:

* improve readme and include into the sphynx doc newer screenshots

* implement the available method of keyword portlet (if there are no keywords the portlet should be not rendered)

* bug: if you choose in the keyword portlet a second level root no leaf are shown

Future:

* improve the usability of keyword tree widget (it should be possible to add new keyword through a + action)
